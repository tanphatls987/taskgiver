v1.00:
Deciding on some small feature.
Currently everything stay in same folder, except log.
Generic task will stay in generic.txt [expect sth at most 10 tasks]
Maybe decide on weekly task, monthly task as well.
Maybe I would learn to get some info from google calendar.

Add log to store last time online => first log in of the day (greeting.txt)



180330:
Write very basic backbone of my program.
Done : get the day mask.
My intention is each logfile only contain a bitstring -> can't update generic task wo info loss.
So I will propagate info into every log file. 
Currently logfile only contain simple info


180331:
Change structure of trie
Will add a run log later.
Basically the program is up and running 
Need to fix get_logname (filename generated not as expected)

180403:
Will consider a refresher when there is a date change.
Will rewrite to include some stat about average time consume, maybe variance as well ?

180407: Will add
Quick add plan
View plan -> Modified -> Rewrite plan
Reminded (add sound with play command(sox))
