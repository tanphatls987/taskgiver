# TaskGiver

## Introduction
A personal project I am doing to motivate myself on doing some chore in my free time, instead of mindlessly sufing website after website.

## Feature

  - Basic interface on command line to give out task.
  - Record start time and finish time of given tasks in a day.
  - Can change generic task list manually.
